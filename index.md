## About

I'm a Lebesgue Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institut de Recherche Mathématique de Rennes](http://irmar.univ-rennes1.fr/) (IRMAR). I'm currently working under the supervision of Frank Loray as part of the Analytic Geometry group at IRMAR.

I received my Ph.D. from [Cornell University](http://www.math.cornell.edu) in 2017. My thesis was directed by Yulij S. Ilyashenko. Previously, I studied at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), where I worked with Laura Ortiz Bobadilla and Ernesto Rosales González at [Instituto de Matemáticas UNAM](http://www.matem.unam.mx/).

I'm mainly interested in the study, both local and global, of holomorphic foliations and vector fields on complex manifolds, and the rich interplay this theory has with dynamical systems, topology, and analytic and algebraic geometry.
